## About Me

I’m a medical student at RCSI Bahrain with a strong interest in omics and translational biomedical science. I’m most fascinated by research that forces you to interrogate not just *what* an association is, but *why* it exists and whether it should change how we think or act. 

Alongside science, I’ve always been drawn to philosophy and enjoy thinking deeply about questions that challenge how we see the world and ourselves.

## Research

- **2023–Present**: Researcher, Postgraduate Department, RCSI Bahrain. My work focuses on the molecular and genetic basis of metabolic diseases, particularly diabetes and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). I use genetic tools, biomarker measurements, and clinical data to understand how these conditions develop, and perhaps more interestingly why they vary between individuals.
- **2024–Present**: Researcher with the Murray Group, Bernal Institute (University of Limerick), working on single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, quantitative pathology, and multi-omic analysis of disease tissue.
- **2024**: Visiting medical student at the Bernal Institute, contributing to lymphoma-related projects using integrated wet-lab and computational approaches.
- **Ongoing**: Independent and collaborative projects as I explore what best suits my interests.

## Extra-Curricular

- **Student Council Research Officer**: Building research infrastructure for students, including mentorship pathways, journal clubs, and method-focused teaching with an emphasis on rigor and reproducibility.
- **Diabetes Mobile Unit Volunteer**: Supporting community-based diabetes education and interdisciplinary outreach initiatives.
